## Loading report data to Amazon QuickSight<a name="cur-query-other-qs"></a>

You can upload your Cost and Usage Reports into Amazon QuickSight\.

For more information about uploading to Amazon QuickSight, see [Creating a Data Set Using Amazon S3 Files](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/create-a-data-set-s3.html) in the *Amazon QuickSight User Guide*\.

## Loading report data to Amazon Redshift<a name="cur-query-other-rs"></a>

This section shows how you can upload AWS CUR to Amazon Redshift to analyze your AWS costs and usage\.

**Important**  
Amazon Redshift columns aren't case sensitive and has stricter character limitations than user\-defined tags\. To prevent conflicts between Amazon Redshift and user\-defined tags, AWS replaces your tags with the tags `userTag0`, `userTag1`, `userTag2`, etc\. After you create an Amazon Redshift table and upload your report into it, you can create an Amazon Redshift table that maps the AWS\-defined tags to your user\-defined tags\. The tag table allows you to look up your original tags\.  
For example, if you have the tags `OWNER` and `Owner`, Amazon Redshift doesn't allow you to create a table with two columns named "owner"\. Instead, you create a report table with the columns `userTag0` and `userTag1` instead of `OWNER` and `Owner`, and then create a table with the columns `remappedUserTag` and `userTag`\. The `remappedUserTag` column stores the AWS\-defined tags `userTag0` and `userTag1`, and the `userTag` column stores your original tags, `OWNER` and `Owner` 

AWS provides the commands to create your Amazon Redshift table, upload your report, create your tag table, and insert all of the tag rows into your tag table\. The commands are provided to you in the `RedshiftCommands.sql` file that is stored alongside your manifest file in S3, and in the **Redshift file** **Helper file** in the Billing and Cost Management console\. AWS also provides a RedshiftManifest file, which controls which report the commands in the RedshiftCommand file uploads\. Deleting or removing the RedshiftManifest file breaks the copy command in the RedshiftCommands file\.

**To find the `RedshiftCommands.sql` file in the Billing and Cost Management console**

1. Sign in to the Billing and Cost Management console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/billing/home\#/](http://console.aws.amazon.com/billing)

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Cost & Usage Reports**\.

1. Choose the report that you want to upload to Amazon Redshift\.

1. Next to **You have enabled viewing reports in the following service\(s\):**, choose **Amazon Redshift**\.

1. Copy the commands from the dialog box and paste them into your SQL client\.

The following procedure assumes familiarity with databases and Amazon Redshift\.

**To upload an Cost and Usage Reports to Amazon Redshift**

1. Create an Amazon Redshift cluster\.

   For more information, see [Creating a Cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/managing-clusters-console.html#create-cluster) in the *Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide*\.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/)\.

1. Navigate to the Amazon S3 location where you store your AWS CUR\.

1. Open the `RedshiftCommands.sql` file\.

   The file contains customized commands to create an Amazon Redshift table, upload the AWS CUR from Amazon S3, and create a tag table that allows user\-defined tags to be imported into Amazon Redshift\.

1. In the `copy` command, replace *<AWS\_ROLE>* with the ARN of an IAM role that has permissions to access the Amazon S3 bucket where you store your AWS CUR\.

1. Replace *<S3\_BUCKET\_REGION>* with the Region your Amazon S3 bucket is in\. For example, `us-east-1`\.

1. Use a SQL client to connect to the cluster\.

   For more information, see [Accessing Amazon Redshift Clusters and Databases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/using-rs-tools.html) in the *Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide*\.

1. Copy the SQL commands from the `RedshiftCommands.sql` file to your SQL client in the following order:
   + create table \- This command creates an Amazon Redshift table with a schema customized to match your report\.
   + copy \- This command uses the provided IAM role to upload the AWS CUR files from S3 to Amazon Redshift\.
   + create tag table \- This command creates a table that allows you to map AWS\-defined tags to your user\-defined tags\.
   + insert \- These commands insert the user\-defined tags into the tag table\.

1. After you have copied all of the data from your AWS CUR into Amazon Redshift, you can query the data using SQL\. For more information about querying data in Amazon Redshift, see [Amazon Redshift SQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c_redshift-sql.html) in the *Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide*\.

**Note**  
The number of columns in Cost and Usage Reports can change from month to month, such as when a new cost allocation tag is created or a service adds a new product attribute\. We recommend that you copy the data from your AWS CUR into a new table every month, and then copy the columns that interest you into a separate month\-by\-month table\.
