# Creating an Athena table<a name="create-manual-table"></a>

AWS includes the SQL that you need to run to create this table in your AWS CUR bucket\.<a name="create-manual-table-steps"></a>

**To create your Athena table**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/)\.

1. From the list of buckets, choose the bucket where you chose to receive your Cost and Usage Reports\.

1. Navigate the path `your-report-prefix-your-report-name-path-to-report`\.

   The exact path depends on whether your AWS CUR is set to overwrite previous versions\. For more information, see [Cost and Usage Reports delivery timelineCost and Usage Reports formatting](access-cur-s3.md#access-cur-s3-timeline)\.

1. Open the file `my-report-name-create-table.sql`\.

1. Copy the SQL from the file, starting with `CREATE` and ending with `LOCATION 's3://your-report-prefix/your-report-name/the-rest-of-the=path'`\. Take note of the first line, as you need the database name and table to create the Athena database\.

1. Open the Athena console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/athena/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/home)\.

1. In the **New query 1** query pane, paste the following SQL\. For *`<database name>.<table name>`*, use the database and table name from the first line of the SQL that you copied\.

   ```
   CREATE DATABASE <database name>
   ```

1. Choose **Run query**\.

1. In the dropdown menu, choose the database that you just created\.

1. In the **New query 1** query pane, paste the rest of the SQL from the SQL file\.

1. Choose **Run query**\.

After you create your table, you need to load your partitions before you can run a query\. For more information, see [Column names](cur-ate-run.md#column-transformations)\.
