# Line item details<a name="Lineitem-columns"></a>

Columns under the **lineItem** header in AWS Cost and Usage Reports are static fields that appear in all Cost and Usage Reports\. They cover all of the cost and usage information for your usage\. This includes the following columns:

[A](#l-A) \| [B](#l-B) \| [C](#l-C) \| D \| E \| F \| G \| H \| I \| J \| K \| [L](#l-L) \| M \| [N](#l-N) \| [O](#l-O) \| [P](billing-columns.md#b-P) \| Q \| [R](#l-R) \| S \| T \| [U](#l-U) \| VWXYZ 

## A<a name="Lineitem-details-A"></a>

### lineItem/AvailabilityZone<a name="Lineitem-details-A-AvailabilityZone"></a>

The Availability Zone that hosts this line item\. For example, `us-east-1a` or `us-east-1b`\.

## B<a name="Lineitem-details-B"></a>

### lineItem/BlendedCost<a name="Lineitem-details-B-BlendedCost"></a>

The `BlendedRate` multiplied by the `UsageAmount`\.

**Note**  
**BlendedCost** is blank for line items that have a **LineItemType** of **Discount**\. Discounts are calculated using only the unblended cost of a member account, aggregated by member account and SKU\. As a result, **BlendedCost** is not available for discounts\.

### lineItem/BlendedRate<a name="Lineitem-details-B-BlendedRate"></a>

The `BlendedRate` is the average cost incurred for each SKU across an organization\.

For example, the Amazon S3 blended rates are the total cost of storage divided by the amount of data stored per month\. For accounts with RIs, the blended rates are calculated as the average costs of the RIs and the On\-Demand Instances\.

Blended rates are calculated at the management account level, and used to allocate costs to each member account\. For more information, see [Blended Rates and Costs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/con-bill-blended-rates.html#Blended_CB) in the *AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide*\.

## C<a name="Lineitem-details-C"></a>

### lineItem/CurrencyCode<a name="Lineitem-details-C-currencyCode"></a>

The currency that this line item is shown in\.

## L<a name="Lineitem-details-L"></a>

### lineItem/LegalEntity<a name="Lineitem-details-L-LegalEntity"></a>

The provider of your AWS services\. Possible values are the following:
+ **Amazon Web Services** – The entity that sells AWS services\.
+ **Amazon Internet Services Pvt\. Ltd** – The local Indian entity that acts as a reseller for AWS services in India\.

### lineItem/LineItemDescription<a name="Lineitem-details-L-LineItemDescription"></a>

The description of the line item type\. For example, the description of a usage line item summarizes what type of usage you incurred during a specific time period\.

For size\-flexible RIs, the description corresponds to the RI the benefit was applied to\. For example, if a line item corresponds to a `t2.micro` and a `t2.small` RI was applied to the usage, the line **item/description** displays `t2.small`\.

The description for a usage line item with an RI discount contains the pricing plan covered by the line item\.

### lineItem/LineItemType<a name="Lineitem-details-L-LineItemType"></a>

The type of charge covered by this line item\. Possible types are the following:
+ **Credit** – Any credits that AWS applied to your bill\. See the **Description** column for details\. AWS might update reports after they have been finalized if AWS applies a credit to your account for the month after finalizing your bill\.
+ **DiscountedUsage** – The rate for any instances for which you had Reserved Instance \(RI\) benefits\.
+ **Fee** – Any upfront annual fee that you paid for subscriptions\. For example, the upfront fee that you paid for an **All Upfront RI** or a **Partial Upfront RI**\.
+ **Refund** – The negative charges that AWS refunded money for\. Check the **Description** column for details\. AWS might update reports after they have been finalized if AWS applies a refund to your account for the month after finalizing your bill\.
+ **RIFee** – The monthly recurring fee for subscriptions\. For example, the recurring fee for **Partial Upfront RI**s, **No Upfront RI**s, and **All Upfront**s that you pay every month\. Although the RIFee might be $0 for all upfront reservations, this line is still populated for those reservation types to provide other columns such as **reservation/AmortizedUpfrontFeeForBillingPeriod** and **reservation/ReservationARN**\.
+ **Tax** – Any taxes that AWS applied to your bill\. For example, VAT or US sales tax\.
+ **Usage** – Any usage that is charged at On\-Demand Instance rates\.
+ **SavingsPlanUpfrontFee** – Any upfront fee you paid for your Savings Plans\. For example, the upfront fee that you paid for an **All Upfront Savings Plan** or a **Partial Upfront Savings Plan**\.
+ **SavingsPlanRecurringFee** – The monthly recurring fee for your Savings Plans related subscriptions\. For example, the recurring monthly fee for a **Partial Upfront Savings Plan** or **No Upfront Savings Plan**\.
+ **SavingsPlanCoveredUsage** – The instances that received benefits from a Savings Plan subscription\.
+ **SavingsPlanNegation** – The Savings Plans discount applied\. The line item contains negative costs \(discounts\)\. This enables you to find the net cost after Savings Plans discounts, using the total sum of the **Unblended Cost**\.

## N<a name="Lineitem-details-N"></a>

### lineItem/NormalizationFactor<a name="Lineitem-details-N-NormalizationFactor"></a>

As long as the instance has shared tenancy, AWS can apply all Regional Linux or Unix Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS RI discounts to all instance sizes in an instance family and AWS Region\. This also applies to RI discounts for member accounts in an organization\. All new and existing Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS size\-flexible RIs are sized according to a normalization factor, based on the instance size\. The following table shows the normalization factor that AWS applies to each instance size\.


**Normalization factors for Amazon EC2 size\-flexible RIs**  

|  Instance size  |  Normalization factor  | 
| --- | --- | 
|  `nano`  |  0\.25  | 
|  `micro`  |  0\.5  | 
|  `small`  |  1  | 
|  `medium`  |  2  | 
|  `large`  |  4  | 
|  `xlarge`  |  8  | 
|  `2xlarge`  |  16  | 
|  `4xlarge`  |  32  | 
|  `8xlarge`  |  64  | 
|  `10xlarge`  |  80  | 
|  `16xlarge`  |  128  | 
|  `32xlarge`  |  256  | 

### lineItem/NormalizedUsageAmount<a name="Lineitem-details-N-NormalizedUsageAmount"></a>

The amount of usage that you incurred, in normalized units, for size\-flexible RIs\. The **NormalizedUsageAmount** is equal to **UsageAmount** multiplied by **NormalizationFactor**\.

## O<a name="Lineitem-details-O"></a>

### lineItem/Operation<a name="Lineitem-details-O-Operation"></a>
