# Monthly Cost Allocation<a name="monthly-cost-allocation"></a>

**Important**  
The Monthly Cost Allocation Report feature will be unavailable at a later date\. We strongly recommend that you use the AWS Cost and Usage Reports instead\.

You can create custom cost allocation tag sets for your AWS resources that can describe the business dimensions of your AWS usage\. These tag sets enable you to organize and track your AWS costs\. Many AWS services expose tagging in their feature sets\. You create the tags within those services by using the console, API, or the AWS command line interface \(CLI\)\. For more information, see [Using Cost Allocation Tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html) in the *AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide*\.

After you create your tags, you can obtain a monthly cost allocation report/\. This is essentially the Monthly Report including your cost allocation tag sets\.
