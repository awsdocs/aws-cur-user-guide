# Monitoring your size flexible reservations<a name="monitor-flexible-reservation"></a>

Amazon EC2 RIs that apply to a Region provide Availability Zone flexibility and instance size flexibility\. RIs that provide Availability Zone flexibility provide a discount on usage in any Availability Zone in the Region\. RIs that provide instance size flexibility provide a discount on usage, regardless of instance size in that family\. To understand how instance size flexibility provided by your RI is applied to your usage, refer to the **lineItem/NormalizationFactor** and **lineItem/NormalizedUsageAmount** columns\.

**Note**  
Instance size flexibility is supported only by Linux or Unix RIs with default tenancy that are assigned to a Region\.

## Example 1<a name="ri-effective-costs-ex1"></a>

You purchase one `m4.xlarge` RI in a given Region\. This `m4.xlarge` RI can be applied automatically to all `m4` instance usage in the same Region\. In the following table, AWS applied the `m4.xlarge` to two separate `m4.large` instances\.

The two `m4.large` usage line items have different **ResourceID**s, and both received a discount benefit from the single `m4.xlarge` RI\. This is shown by matching the **reservationARN** value across the usage and recurring monthly charge line items\.

## Example 2<a name="ri-effective-costs-ex2"></a>

The following table shows an account that has subscriptions for two `m4.large` RIs, with one RI in each subscription\. In this example, the account uses a single instance of `m4.xlarge` for an hour and receives a separate discount benefit from each of the two `m4.large` RIs\.

The single hour of `m4.xlarge` usage is split into two lines of 0\.5 hours \(both usage lines still retain the same **ResourceID**\) because different RI subscriptions were applied to each portion of that single hour\. The **reservationARN** for each 0\.5 hour matches the corresponding RI subscription\.
