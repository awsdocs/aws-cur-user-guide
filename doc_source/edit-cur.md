# Editing your Cost and Usage Reports configuration<a name="edit-cur"></a>

You can use the **Cost & Usage Reports** page in the Billing and Cost Management console to edit Cost and Usage Reports\.

**Note**  
Report names can't be edited\. If you chose **Overwrite** for **Report versioning**, you're unable to edit the report name, whether the report includes resource IDs, time granularity, or the report versioning\. If you delete a report set to **Overwrite** and create a new report with the same name, Amazon S3 bucket, and path prefix, your data could corrupt and become inaccurate\.<a name="edit-cur-steps"></a>
